  "Author": "Brett Hoebel",

  "Quotes": "If I could give one tip for people - it's not an exercise or nutrition regimen. It's to walk your talk and believe in yourself, because at the end of the day, the dumbbell and diet don't get you in shape. It's your accountability to your word."

{
  "Author": "Brett Hoebel",
  "Category": "diet",
  "Quotes": "If you think of exercise as a 60-minute commitment 3 times a week at the gym, you're missing the point completely.
